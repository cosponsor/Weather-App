This project was only tested using netlify.

In order to be able to get the weather of a specified location, you would input the url as something like your.site/london.

There is no real parsing for the location, so it will show dashes, and it doesnt autocapitalize. (I wasn't lazy, just didnt seem too needed. Since this is a learning resource, you can learn to add that!)
