This project was only tested using netlify. (Which is why the main stuff is handled in the 404.html)

If you would like to change how it is managed, just replace the contents of index.html with the contents of 404.html.

In order to be able to get the weather of a specified location, you would input the url as something like your.site/london.

There is no real parsing for the location, so it will show dashes, and it doesnt autocapitalize. (I wasn't lazy, just didnt seem too needed. Since this is a learning resource, you can learn to add that!)
